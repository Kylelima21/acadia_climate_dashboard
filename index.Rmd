## Acadia Climate Data Dashboard Project

This project's github repository can be found here: <https://github.com/Kylelima21/acadia_climate_dashboard>

This file is for downloading Acadia National Park climate data and data cleaning scripts. This data is used in the Acadia Climate Data R Shiny Dashboard (). Cleaning scripts only require the input of the downloaded datasets to run in R.
